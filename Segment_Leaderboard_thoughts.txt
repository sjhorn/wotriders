Segment Leaderboard thoughts

1. Get athlete ids from club wotriders

eg. http://app.strava.com/api/v1/clubs/18485/members


2. For each athlete get rides

eg. http://app.strava.com/api/v1/rides?athleteId=1300808     (if more than 50 results add offset += 50)

##3. Get each ride totals
##eg. http://app.strava.com/api/v1/rides/32405857

4. Get each ride efforts  (this includes the segment name/id)

eg. http://www.strava.com/api/v2/rides/32405857/efforts

Club segment best

http://app.strava.com/api/v1/segments/654754/efforts?clubId=18485&best=true

create tabs for:
    # all club segments ridden (even if its only me, or danny, or scott, anyone)
    # all segments that everyone have ridden (if there is a newbie it won't show till he rides it as well)
    # all segments that at least two people have ridden (a better approach for the issue above)
    # maybe a search that loads a js file and indexes the table for search.
